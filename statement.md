This is a small Python project where I built a basic Banking Management System.
The program lets users create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balance.
All the details are stored in a JSON file so the data stays saved even after the program closes.
I made this project to practice Python basics like functions, loops, and file handling.
It’s a simple console-based program, but it helped me understand how real systems store and manage data.
Anyone can download or modify the code if they want to experiment or improve it further.
