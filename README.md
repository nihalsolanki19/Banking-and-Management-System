# Bank-Management-System
This project is a banking system made using Python. It works on the command line and allows the user to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check the balance. All the account details are saved in a JSON file so that the data does not get lost after closing the program.
## What This Project Does
1. Lets a user create a new bank account
2. Allows depositing money into an account
3. Allows withdrawing money (only if the balance is enough)
4. Shows the balance of any account
5. Stores all the account data in a file called bank_data.json

The project mainly uses Python’s basic concepts like functions, loops, file handling, and condition checking.
## How To Run The Program
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Save the code in a file named banking.py.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and go to the project folder.
4. Run the command: python banking.py

Once the program starts, it will show a menu where you can choose what you want to do.
## How Each Option Works
### Create Account
The program asks for your name and an initial deposit. Then it creates a 5-digit account number and saves all the details to the JSON file.
### Deposit
You enter your account number and the amount you want to deposit. The balance updates and is saved.
### Withdraw
You enter your account number and the amount to withdraw. The program checks if you have enough balance before allowing the withdrawal.
### Balance Check
Shows the current balance of the given account number.
## Why This Project is Useful
1. It is easy to understand and good for beginners
2. Helps practice file handling in Python
3. Shows how to build a menu-based application

4. Suitable for school and college projects
